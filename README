Catalyst::Model::ISBNDB - Access to the isbndb.com API as a Catalyst model
==========================================================================

Version: 0.21


WHAT IS IT
----------

This is a module to provide programmatic access to the database of book and
author information hosted by isbndb.com (see http://isbndb.com) to a Catalyst
application, as a Model in the MVC scheme. To access the API provided by the
site, you will have to register a user account and create an access key.


BUILDING/INSTALLING
-------------------

This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension. To
build:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make all
        make test

If Catalyst::Model::ISBNDB passes all tests, then:

        make install

You may need super-user access to install.
